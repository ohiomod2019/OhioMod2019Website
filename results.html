        <h2 class="sectionsmalltitle">Background</h2>
    <p class="text1">	DNA Origami is a self-assembly technique used to design and build custom DNA nanostructures. DNA origami relies on Watson-Crick complementary base pairing  to bind a long single stranded piece of DNA called the scaffold with many smaller, shorter, single stranded DNA pieces called oligos. When scaffold and oligos are bound together via base-pairing in a specified manner, a desired structure is self-assembled. DNA origami designs and structures include dynamic mechanisms with 1-D and 2-D motion (1,2). Furthermore, DNA origami actuation has been explored in plasmonic nanorods movement along a DNA origami structure (3), DNA walkers (4), and one-way motion of a DNA modified particle along a gold film using RNAse (5). However, there has yet been a DNA origami structure moving along a DNA origami path. Here, we propose to develop such a mechanism using strand displacement to actuate a DNA origami Gear along a DNA origami Track. 
</p>
  <h2 class="sectionsmalltitle">Structure Design</h2>
    <p class="text1">The aim of this project was to create a DNA origami ring-shaped structure or “gear” capable of moving along a DNA origami track. The “gear” is comprised of twelve 14hb segments connected by single-stranded scaffold regions to create a round closed loop 60nm in diameter. The track is a 200nm in length 14hb with a honey-comb cross section. The “gear” and track were designed in an in-house CAD program, tweaked in cadnano, and verified through OxDNA simulations.

    <p class="text1">(Magnesium screen, 2.5 d, with overhang)
After the addition of the overhang, the structures for gear and track were changed, new concentration and new folding temperature needs to be redefined for both gear and track.  (cite: A Primer to Scaffolded DNA origami)


(Rapid fold, 4 hr, with overhang)
Folding temperature needs to be determined under the new magnesium concentration.  (cite: Rapid Folding of DNA into Nanoscale Shapes at Constant Temperature by Dietz)
 

(PEG Purification)
Polyethylene glycol centrifugation purification is used to easily purify excess staples from a folding reaction. (cite: Facile and Scalable Preparation of Pure and Dense DNA Origami Solutions by Dietz)

(Actuation, blockers and removals)
To enable the gears to roll on the tracks, strand displacement was performed step-by-step. 
Step 1. Track and gear were diluted to 1:2 in concentration. In this project, 10 nM track and 20 nM gear were used.
Step 2. Blockers C, D, E, and F were added to the track, with concentration of the mixture of blockers to be 10x of the concentration of the track. Once the blockers were added, the tube was labeled as “reaction tube” or “RT”, and was put into the thermomixer at 25 C, 250 rpm for 30 minutes.
Step 3. Overhangs C, D, E, and F on the track were blocked, while overhangs A and B were remained open. Gear was added to the reaction tube, and the reaction tube was put into the thermomixer at 25 C, 250 rpm for 24 hours. 
Step 4. After 24 hours, gears and tracks have overhangs A and B binded. To perform strand displacement, one previous overhang on the track was blocked and the next overhang blocker was removed to allow the gears to move one step on the track. (i.e. Add blocker A to disconnect the binded overhang A, and add removal C to remove blocker C on the tracks, so that gears and tracks will have overhangs B and C binded)

This project aims to design, fabricate and actuate a dynamic mechanism,consisting of a nanoscale Track and Gear. We validated the successful characterization of both structures via agarose gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, we modified both structures with the addition of specific single stranded DNA overhangs for actuation. Using intermediate single stranded DNA blockers, we can bind the Gear to the Track and validate the successful attachments via TEM. As proof of concept for movement of the Gear along the Track we have also shown control over specific location of the binding of the Gear to the Track. The motion of the Gear on the Track resembles the motion of a rack and pinion gear system. This actuation has applications such as delivery, nano computing and transmission of material or data. In the future, we seek to explore the capabilities of our mechanism for such applications.

</h2>
    <p class="text1">Future work consists of three outlooks. The first direction optimizes the binding and detachment of the Gear on the Track by varying the number of overhangs in each site. At each overhang site, there are three overhangs. This makes it challenging to remove the Gear from the Track, which results in low efficiency for actuation. We aim to investigate the effect of folding the Gear and Track with one or two overhangs at each site to analyze the efficiency of attachment, detachment, and actuation of the Gear on the Track. We hypothesis that the reduction of overhangs at each site will decrease the attachment efficiency, however, we expect a higher detachment and consequently higher actuation efficiencies.  
Our next direction aims to actuate the Gear across a longer scale.  More overhang sites can be added to one Track allowing the Gear to move across the full length of the Track. We also seek to polymerize the Track to make longer and more complex paths for the Gear to follow. 
Our final direction aims to visualizing the movement or actuation of the Gear on the Track in real-time. We currently use TEM to image the static structures after actuation, however we are limited to 2-D images with no real-time visualization capability. We aim to modify our structure with FRET pair and implement single molecule microscopy to visualize the Gear and Track movement in real-time.
