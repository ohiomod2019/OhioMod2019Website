<h1>Abstract</h2>
<p>DNA nanotechnology, specifically DNA origami, has rapidly developed to design functional nanostructures over the past decade. DNA origami is a self-assembly process where we can create nano-scale structures with programmable motion. Actuation of DNA nanostructures is of particular interest for multiple applications such as nano-computation, biomolecular delivery, and data transmission. While many methods and mechanisms of actuation have already been explored, no research so far has examined the possibility of a DNA origami machine moving on a DNA origami track. Thus, the objective of the current study is to design a DNA origami nanomachine capable of rolling on a specific DNA track. The DNA track is a 14-helix bundle, 200nM in length with different sets of overhangs. The rolling component, called the gear is a 12 sided polygon with single stranded overhangs all around the perimeter. These gear overhangs are designed to bind to the track via intermediate strands and the gear moves along the track using strand displacement. We have bound the gear to the track as well as validated the motion along the track. Future work consists of creating a more complex track as well as a multi-gear system capable of transmitting data. </p>
