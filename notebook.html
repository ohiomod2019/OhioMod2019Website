  <h2 class="sectionsmalltitle">Structure Design</h2>
    <p class="text1">The aim of this project was to create a DNA origami ring-shaped structure or “gear” capable of moving along a DNA origami track. The “gear” is comprised of twelve 14hb segments connected by single-stranded scaffold regions to create a round closed loop 60nm in diameter. The track is a 200nm in length 14hb with a honey-comb cross section. The “gear” and track were designed in an in-house CAD program, tweaked in cadnano, and verified through OxDNA simulations. 
</p>
<h2 class="sectionsmalltitle">Structure Characterization</h2>
<p class="text1">
For both the gear and track, the optimal concentration of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) was defined with a MgCl2 gradient during a 2.5 day annealing ramp protocol similar </p>

Once optimal MgCl2 conditions are known further characterization  includes a 4-hour annealing ramp of a temperature gradient from 60°C-40°C.

</h1>

  <h2 class="sectionsmalltitle">
</h2>
    <p class="text1">Future work consists of three outlooks. The first direction optimizes the binding and detachment of the Gear to the Track by varying the number of overhangs in each site. At each overhang site, there are three overhangs. This makes it challenging to remove the Gear from the Track, which results in low efficiency for actuation. We aim to investigate the effect of folding the Gear and Track with one or two overhangs at each site to analyze the efficiency of attachment, detachment, and actuation of the Gear on the Track. We hypothesis that the reduction of overhangs at each site will decrease the attachment efficiency, however, we expect a higher detachment and consequently higher actuation efficiencies.   
Our final direction consists of using fluorescence microscopy to visualize the movement or actuation of the Gear on the Track in real-time. We aim to use single-molecule 



The track structures are polymerized with the length of 200 nm, and the distance between the first location (AB) and the final location (EF) was calculated to be approximately 30 nm, which is only 15% of the overall length of the track. In the future, more sites can be created for actuation, so that the gear will be able to move further on the track. 



In this project, TEM was the only device that allows us to observe the gear and track structures, which is only able to provide static images. The movement of gear on the track could not be observed directly with TEM. In the future, single molecule fluorescence imaging can be used to visualize gear movement in real time.

  <h2 class="sectionsmalltitle">Gear and Track with overhangs
</h2>
    <p class="text1">(Magnesium screen, 2.5 d, with overhang)
After the addition of the overhang, the structures for gear and track were changed, new concentration and new folding temperature needs to be redefined for both gear and track.  (cite: A Primer to Scaffolded DNA origami)


(Rapid fold, 4 hr, with overhang)
Folding temperature needs to be determined under the new magnesium concentration.  (cite: Rapid Folding of DNA into Nanoscale Shapes at Constant Temperature by Dietz)
 

(PEG Purification)
Polyethylene glycol centrifugation purification is used to easily purify excess staples from a folding reaction. (cite: Facile and Scalable Preparation of Pure and Dense DNA Origami Solutions by Dietz)

(Actuation, blockers and removals)
To enable the gears to roll on the tracks, strand displacement was performed step-by-step. 
Step 1. Track and gear were diluted to 1:2 in concentration. In this project, 10 nM track and 20 nM gear were used.
Step 2. Blockers C, D, E, and F were added to the track, with concentration of the mixture of blockers to be 10x of the concentration of the track. Once the blockers were added, the tube was labeled as “reaction tube” or “RT”, and was put into the thermomixer at 25 C, 250 rpm for 30 minutes.
Step 3. Overhangs C, D, E, and F on the track were blocked, while overhangs A and B were remained open. Gear was added to the reaction tube, and the reaction tube was put into the thermomixer at 25 C, 250 rpm for 24 hours. 
Step 4. After 24 hours, gears and tracks have overhangs A and B binded. To perform strand displacement, one previous overhang on the track was blocked and the next overhang blocker was removed to allow the gears to move one step on the track. (i.e. Add blocker A to disconnect the binded overhang A, and add removal C to remove blocker C on the tracks, so that gears and tracks will have overhangs B and C binded)
